\section{Complexity and Refactoring}

The first step of this article is to explain what is Complexity and how to observe it.

% \cite{article:sonarpaper} starts their paper describing McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity, as the past tool for
% measuring the complexity of a code, that attempts to be a mathematical model, formulated for Fortran, but not
% includes modern blocks like try/catch and lambdas; it acknowledges this metric as of little use above the method
% level.

% We can start by defining four major classes of code complexity: code size, represented by lines of code;
% vocabulary size, by Halstead metrics; control-flow complexity, McCabe's Cyclomatic Complexity; and data-flow complexity

Researches and practitioners alike know that to write code is to add more features to a system, increasing the
perception of complexity \cite{book:menmonth}. As a part of their activities, and to reduce the unstoppable ball of mud
threat \cite{book:softarch}, common refactoring patterns are applied so that it reduces the complexity of any given
system \cite{book:refactoring}.

\cite{article:fmricc} will bring four classes to define metrics of complexity of code, starting with lines of code,
vocabulary, execution paths and data dependencies.
