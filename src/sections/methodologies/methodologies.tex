\section{Methodologies}

Applying the metrics from \cite{article:mozilla} tool, we are able to calculate the impact of each refactoring example
described in Fowler's refactoring book. To begin analyzing this data we adopted a folder strategy to separate by unique refactor,
containing a before and after file. Then, we transform the output of each file - their complexity metrics - into SQL statements,
to be added into a SQL database for the analysis of the next section.

Starting at Chapter 6, \cite{book:refactoring} will present the first set of patterns, as they are the most common ones.
The next chapters are going to talk about encapsulation, moving resources, organizing data, simplifying conditionals,
refactoring APIs and dealing with inheritance.
