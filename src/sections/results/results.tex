\section{The Impact of Common Refactor Patterns}

Applying the metrics from \cite{article:mozilla} we are able to calculate the complexity from before and after of each
refactoring example described in Fowler's refactoring book. To begin analyzing this data we adopted a folder strategy to
separate by unique refactor pattern, containing a before and after javascript file. Then, we transform the output of
each file - their complexity metrics - into SQL statements, that are executed into a SQLite database for storage. In the
last step we utilize SQL to distinguish the values extracted from each example and storing their differences in tables
inside the database, to later be utilized in the analysis described in the next section.


In this section we show the numeric impact from before and after, while explaining the metric, covering the patterns for
106, 115, 119, 123, 124, 132, 137, 140, 144, 149 and 154 pattern codes.
