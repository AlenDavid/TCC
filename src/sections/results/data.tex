\subsection{106. Extract Function}

The opposite of inline a function, this pattern creates a new function (but can also be a method or procedure) where the
code content will be the lines we are extracting from another block of code.
There's two useful situations we can use this: the first being repeated code across the application, so we wrap that code
in a function and call it there; the second is to keep code cohesion, where reading the code explains the code.

For Cyclomatic Complexity, we identified that variable sum increased by 1; this is a clear indication that we have a new
function being accounted for this metric.

For Halstead we identified a few small changes: the variable bugs increased by 0.01, difficulty increased by 0.8,
distinct\_operands increased by 1, effort increased by 343.13, length increased by 9, level decreased by -0.03,
purity\_ratio decreased by -0.26, time increased by 19.06, total\_occurrences\_of\_operands increased by 4,
variable total\_occurrences\_of\_operators increased by 5, vocabulary increased by 1, volume increased by 40.09.
Putting in perspective, vocabulary and distinct\_operands have the real impact as adding a new function increases
the size of code for this example.
