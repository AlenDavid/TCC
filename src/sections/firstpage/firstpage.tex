  For years one of the major impacts of software development speed is how complex the program is, impacting directly on
  how long it takes for a qualified engineer to make impactful changes. To reduce the time developers take to understand
  and submit changes to a system, the community will suggest refactoring, the act of rewriting code without changing
  the qualities of a program.
  In this paper we measure the impact of refactor patterns found in \cite{book:refactoring}.
